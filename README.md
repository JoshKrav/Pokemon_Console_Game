# Pokemon Console Game

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

This was my first ever large-scale coding project! Due to it being my first project, the code is definitly not great but I'm still proud of what I was able to do with the limited skill I had!
In this console game, you play as a grunt from the evil organization Team Plasma. Your goal is to fight and steal as many Pokemon as you can! When your partner Pokemon faints its game over.
